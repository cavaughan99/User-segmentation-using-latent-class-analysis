# User-segmentation-using-latent-class-analysis

This repository contains two R script files:

1) User segmentation using latent class analysis: Using the R packages mclust and tidyLPA, latent class analysis is conducted to
segment, i.e., identify homogeneous groups of, caregivers with respect to their levels of social support, loneliness, 
and other indicators of interpersonal functioning. 

2) User segmentation part 2 -- regression of psychological health on class membership: The latent classes identified are validated by examining the associations of classes with psychological health indicators, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, and hopefulness. The classes are also described and contrasted in terms of members' sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics of their care recipients, and aspects of the caregiving context (e.g., number of hours spent caregiving per week).
